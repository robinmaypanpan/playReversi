# Reversi for PlayDate with AI

The classic abstract strategy game Reversi!  In this game, two players face off to take control of the board by flipping pieces to their side. The game ends when all players have completely filled the board, with the player with the most pieces winning!

I created this for the Play Date as a way to learn its SDK.  I had some challenges along the way trying to get the AI to play nice with the game loop, but I think I managed to get it there!

This is an implementation of the game Reversi for the Play Date handheld gaming console.  You can get your own at [play.date](https://play.date)!

The game will be available on itch.io for download, or you can download it here for free!
